# Test Blog Post

This is a test post to verify that our markdown rendering is working correctly.

## Basic Formatting

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*. We can also use `inline code` like this.

## Lists

### Unordered List
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### Ordered List
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Blocks

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

And here's some Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

## Links and Images

Here's a [link to Google](https://google.com).

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It should be styled differently from regular text.
> 
> It can span multiple lines.

## Conclusion

If you can read this and all the formatting looks correct, then the markdown rendering is working properly!
