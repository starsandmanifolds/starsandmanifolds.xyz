C++ has evolved significantly since C++11, introducing features that make systems programming safer and more expressive without sacrificing performance. Let's explore how modern C++ enhances systems programming.

## Smart Pointers: Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection

One of the biggest improvements in modern C++ is automatic memory management through smart pointers:

```cpp
// Old way - manual memory management
Widget* widget = new Widget();
// ... use widget
delete widget; // Easy to forget!

// Modern way - automatic cleanup
auto widget = std::make_unique<Widget>();
// Automatically cleaned up when out of scope
```

## Move Semantics: Zero-Cost Abstractions

Move semantics enable efficient resource transfer without copying:

```cpp
std::vector<int> createLargeVector() {
    std::vector<int> vec(1'000'000);
    // ... populate vector
    return vec; // No copy! Move semantics in action
}
```

## Concepts: Type-Safe Generic Programming

C++20 introduces concepts for better template constraints:

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Numeric = std::is_arithmetic_v<T>;

template<Numeric T>
T multiply(T a, T b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

## Coroutines for Asynchronous Systems

C++20 coroutines enable efficient async programming:

```cpp
task<int> async_computation() {
    auto data = co_await fetch_data();
    auto result = co_await process_data(data);
    co_return result;
}
```

## Performance Benefits

Modern C++ features often provide better performance:

1. **Copy elision**: Compilers eliminate unnecessary copies
2. **constexpr**: Compile-time computation
3. **Perfect forwarding**: Zero-overhead abstractions

## Real-World Applications

These features are particularly valuable in:
- Operating system components
- Embedded systems
- High-frequency trading systems
- Game engines
- Database engines

## Conclusion

Modern C++ provides powerful tools for systems programming that improve safety and expressiveness without compromising the performance that makes C++ ideal for systems work. The key is understanding when and how to apply these features effectively.
